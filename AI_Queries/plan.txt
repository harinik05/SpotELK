what do i need for this to work?


1. Get some common statistics for how you can use this query language
in different environments and with respect to your library
2. Do some research into the LLM we'll be using 
3. Create some way of classifying them- command line tool in python that you'll be able to use 
4. Find a way to display them on some kind of a page to see the list of things you'll be needing
